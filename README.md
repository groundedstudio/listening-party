# Listening Party
Use Twitter and (optionally, if using a desktop browser) Spotify to create easy to follow listening parties.

### How it Works

The listening party page will contain a Twitter Timeline automatically updating with tweets relevant to the party. If you open the page before the party start time, there's a countdown to the start time.

If you've connected with Spotify (Desktop Only atm sorry):
- Music will begin playing in the browser at the party start time.
- If you join after the start time, you'll automatically skip to the same point in the music as everyone else.
- After playing, you can swap playback to any other Spotify Connect'd device.

If not:
- Hit play on the music, using whichever method you prefer, at the party start time.
- If you join after the start time, a track indicator will show you which track is currently playing, and how far through you should start it.

Check out the [rolling demo](demo) - the party starts on the hour, every hour.

### Setting up a Listening Party
1. The organiser of the listening party contacts via [email](mailto:sam@groundedstudio.co.uk?subject=Listening-Party-Request) with the following information:
    - The time (including timezone code) at which the party should start
    - A link to the Twitter Moment/List which will collate relevant tweets
    - A tracklist of songs to be played during the listening party, including exact lengths of each track
    - (Optionally) a list of Spotify track URIs which correlates with the above tracklist.
2. That's it, your listening party will magically appear!
3. Please contact at least a couple days before you need the party to be live; this is a side project being ran in spare time.

Price: Â£0.00

If you want number of participant data etc. that's also possible, make sure to mention it in your email.
